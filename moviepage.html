			No Country for Old Men is a 2007 American crime thriller film written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name. A cat and mouse thriller starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin, it follows a Texas welder and Vietnam veteran in the desert landscape of 1980 West Texas. The film revisits the themes of fate, conscience, and circumstance that the Coen brothers had explored in the films Blood Simple (1984) and Fargo (1996).

			More critics included No Country for Old Men on their 2007 top ten lists than any other film, and many regard it as the Coen brothers' best film. As of February 2018, various sources had recognized it as one of the best films of its decade and still one of the best films of the 2000s. The Guardian's John Patterson wrote: "the Coens' technical abilities, and their feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah, are matched by few living directors", and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that it is "a new career peak for the Coen brothers" and "as entertaining as hell". In 2016, it was voted the 10th best film of the 21st century as picked by 177 film critics from around the world.

	Plot
</p></h2>
	<p>
	In Texas 1980, the hitman Anton Chigurh strangles a deputy sheriff to escape custody and uses a captive bolt pistol to kill a driver and steal his car. He spares the life of a gas 	station owner, who accepts a challenge and successfully guesses the result of Chigurh's coin flip.

	Hunting pronghorns in the desert, Llewelyn Moss comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. He finds several dead men and dogs, a wounded Mexican begging for water, and two million dollars in a briefcase. He takes the money and returns home. That night, Moss returns to the scene with water. He is pursued by two men in a truck and escapes. At home, he sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother, then drives to a motel in Del Rio, where he hides the case in his room’s air conditioning duct.

	Chigurh, hired to recover the money, kills his employers after obtaining a clue to Moss' identity. Arriving to search Moss' home, he uses his bolt pistol to blow out the lock. Investigating the intrusion, Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell observes the blown-out lock. Following an electronic tracking device in the case, Chigurh goes to Moss' motel room and kills a group of Mexicans who are waiting to ambush Moss. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans' room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the case just before Chigurh opens the duct and finds it empty.

	Moving to a hotel in the border town of Eagle Pass, Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, killing a civilian, and both are wounded. Moss flees across to Mexico, stashing the case in weeds along the Rio Grande. A passing norteno band takes him to a hospital. Carson Wells, another hired operative, fails to persuade Moss to accept protection in return for the money. Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies and sneaks up on Wells at his hotel. After Wells unsuccessfully attempts to barter for his life, Chigurh kills him in his hotel room. Moss telephones the room and Chigurh answers, telling Moss that he will kill him and promises to also kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money.

	Moss retrieves the case from the bank of the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in El Paso, where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean is approached by Sheriff Bell, who promises to protect Moss. Carla Jean's mother unwittingly reveals Moss' location to a group of Mexicans who had been tailing them. Bell reaches the motel rendezvous at El Paso, only to hear gunshots and spot a pickup truck speeding from the motel. As Bell enters the parking lot, he sees Moss lying dead. When Carla Jean arrives, she chokes up upon finding out her husband is dead.

	That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and finds the lock blown out. Chigurh hides behind the door. Bell enters Moss' room and sees that the vent has been removed. Later, Bell visits his uncle Ellis, an ex-lawman, and tells him he plans to retire because he feels "over-matched". Ellis clarifies that the region has always been violent.

	Weeks later, Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom, as per his threat to Moss. She refuses his offer of a coin toss for her life, stating that the choice is entirely his own. Chigurh leaves the house and checks the soles of his boots. As he drives away through the neighborhood, a car crashes into his at an intersection and Chigurh is injured. He bribes two young witnesses for their silence before fleeing.

	Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, he and his father were riding through a snowy mountain pass, his father had gone ahead to light a fire in the darkness and wait for Bell.
